I've been and lived in so many places in my life). I currently live in the city of Bryansk.

# Education

In 2002, she graduated from Alekseevskaya Secondary School.  
In 2007, Bryansk State Technical University (BSTU) with a degree in engineering (instrument systems for mechanical engineering production).



In 2023, she entered her own university in the Department of Digital Economy in the Master's program in the specialty "Strategy and Management of Innovations". I hope to finish it this year.

In fact, I love to study, to learn something new. For me, learning is valuable in itself).


Work
I have been working since I was 17. My track record is quite extensive. Unfortunately, I can't stay in one place for long, my inquisitive mind gets bored and looks for something else to prove itself in)

A year and a half ago I got into the InvestFuture community. I met a lot of good guys, and in addition to financial literacy skills, I slowly began to immerse myself in the world of crypto).

A year ago, I registered on the ByBit exchange, in April I got into the NFT movement, and despite the fact that it seems like I've already gone through a lot, I understand that I still don't know a damn thing)
At the end of last year, I graduated from the validator school. So far, I'm validating 2 projects: Juno and Sentinel.

I plan to become a mentor in the humanities for girls entering school.

I love life, the world, people and for the most part I'm happy). I'm fond of photography, different types of creativity and chatting))).
